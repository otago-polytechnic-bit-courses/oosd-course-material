    "For this assessment, you will use Python/OO design patterns with Jupyter Notebook to solve 15 problems. This will consist of five written, five programming & five unit testing problems. All programming solutions should adhere to the design pattern's UML diagram as described in the lecture slides. You are allowed to deviate from this as long as you are solving the problem using the correct description/template. In addition, marks will also be given for code elegance, functionality, robustness & git usage."

Eventually, the sorting algorithm will need to at least compare two items. Of course, this depends on the type of items being compared. For example, we can easily compare two integers - true or false, does x equal y? What happens if we want to compare people objects. It can be done by comparing person a's last name with person b's last name. However, the comparison could be made on another field, such as first name, mobile number, email address, etc. There is a clear distinction between the sorting algorithm & the operation that is dependent on the data. The same distinction exists for other algorithms such as searching."
