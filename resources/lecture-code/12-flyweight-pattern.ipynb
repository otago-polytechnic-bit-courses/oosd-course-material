    "# The flyweight pattern is particularly useful in a multi-threaded \n",

    "# used safely at the same time by multiple threads. Meaning, there is no chance that\n",

    "# flyweight pattern in a concurrent environment, you should consider using locks to ensure that\n",

    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "# - Reduced memory usage - when we have a lot of similar objects in our application, it is always \n",

    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "# - Trading memory over CPU cycles when context data needs to be recalculated.\n",
    "# - Complicated code - Using flyweight pattern always increases the \n",
