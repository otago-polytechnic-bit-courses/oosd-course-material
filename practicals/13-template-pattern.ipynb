    "**Task 1:** In this task, you will:\n",
    "1. Create an interface called `Pokemon` with the class attributes `name`, `power`, `attack` & `defence`. This class will have an abstract method called `calculate_impact` with the argument `multiplier`. The formula for this will be determined later in it's concrete classes. This class also has three other methods, `calculate_multiplier` which returns 0.5 * `power` * `random()`, `show_damage` which prints the Pokemon's damage & `calculate_damage` (template method) which calls the aforementioned methods.\n",
    "2. Create a class called `FightingPokemon` which implements `Pokemon`. `calculate_impact` returns the following formula: `attack` / `defence` * `multiplier` + 1. Make sure you `floor` the result.\n",
    "3. Create a class called `GroundPokemon` which implements `Pokemon`. `calculate_impact` returns the following formula: `attack` - `defence` * `multiplier` + 1. Make sure you `floor` the result.\n",
    "4. Create a class called `WaterPokemon` which implements `Pokemon`. `calculate_impact` returns the following formula: `attack` + `defence` * `multiplier` + 1. Make sure you `floor` the result.\n",
    "5. In the `main` method, create an object for each type of `Pokemon`. Call it's `__str__` and `calculate_damage` methods. "
