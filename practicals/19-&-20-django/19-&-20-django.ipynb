    "**What is MVC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MVC** or **Model, View, Controller** is an architectural design pattern, primarily used in developing web applications. The pattern is made up of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model - responsible for managing data.\n",
    "- View - responsible for displaying data to the user.\n",
    "- Controller - responsible for the interactions between the model & view.\n",
    "\n",
    "A design principle you should be familiar with is **separation of concerns** or **SoC**. When developing, you want to separate your program or application into distinct components, such that each component addresses a separate concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lets dive into the brief history...**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trygve Reenskaug** formulated the **MVC** pattern for **GUI** software design in 1979 while visiting **Xerox PARC**. Since then, **MVC** pattern has envolved, giving rise to variants such as **HMVC**, **MVA**, **MVP** & **MVVM**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**MVC** pattern in web applications exploded in popularity after the introduction of **NeXT's WebObjects** in 1996. Over the past 20 years we have seen the rise of **MVC** frameworks such as **Spring**, **Django**, **Rails** & **Laravel**. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is MVT?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MVT** or **Model, View Template** is slightly different to **MVC** or **Model, View, Controller**. The main difference between the two patterns is that **Django** handles the **controller** component. The **view** component is handles with the business logic of the application, while the **template** component handles the UI of the application. In Django, a template is a file containing **HTML** & **DTL**. The language syntax is very similar to **Jinja2**.\n",

    "## Django\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "**Django** is a **free** & **open-source** **Python** web framework which follows the **Model, View, Template (MVT)** or **Model, Template, View (MTV)** architectural pattern. The goal of **Django** is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven applications. Emphasising on reusability & pluggability of components...remember **DRY**...don't repeat yourself, less code, low coupling, high cohension & rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual Environment\n",
    "**pipenv** is a tool that automatically creates & manages virtual environments for your applications. This includes adding & removing packages from your **Pipfile** as you install & uninstall packages. When you create a virtual environment, a **Pipfile.lock** file will generate. This is used to produce deterministic builds. For those who are enrolled in **Web 3**, this is similar to **package.json**.\n",

    "`Breed` model class stores information about dog breeds.

    "\n",
    "Note the following field options:\n",
    "- choices - a sequence consisting of tuples used as choices for specific fields. If choices are given, they are enforced by model validation. The first element of each tuple is the actual value to be set on the model & the second element is the human-readable name.\n",
    "- null - if `True`, **Django** will store empty values as `NULL` in the database. Default is `False`. It is recommended that you avoid using null on string-based fields such as **CharField** & **TextField**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BreedManager` manager class is the interface which database query operations are provided to the `Breed` model class. At least one manager exists for every model in a **Django** application. `BreedManager` has one method called `filter`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "A method called `filter` takes `self` & `**filtering` as an argument...remember, `**` means keyword arguments or kwargs. The variable `filtering` stores a dictionary or key/value pairs returned from the `POST` request...you will look at this later on. For example, in the expected output below, I want a dog breed that is good with children & has a short coat length. In this instance, the dictionary returned would be `{'good_with_children': '1', 'coat_length': 'SH'}`. The variable `query_set` returns a list of all `Breed` objects. The method itself returns a list of `Breed` objects that meet the condition as mentioned before. If I was to print out the result of the filtered `query_set`, I would see a list of three `Breed` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can recall earlier, at least one manager exists for every model in a **Django** application. Currently, this manager is not associated with any model class. You need to add the following code to the `Breed` model class.\n",
