The `read` method should print out the current users & number of current user's, for example, **There are 3 users: Clark, Harrison, Ryan**.  The `add` method should append a new `user` to the list of current users. Print out a message when a new user has been added, for example, **User added: John**.\n",

The `add` method should ask the user for the `secret_code`, if the user provides the correct `secret_code`, then the user will be added.
